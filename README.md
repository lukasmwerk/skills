The contents of the folders above are for my own personal use, tracking my knowledge and slowly backing up years of notes. The overview below is probably best if you want to quickly get an idea of what I know.\

Note: This list only really includes concrete technical skills and technologies. I think of what makes up my engineering chops as much more than just the technologies I know and how fast I can code, but for the purposes of this skills overview, I'm highlighting the tangibles.

## Skills Overview 
*Only includes the most relevant skills*
- *Know the Basics = I am familiar with the mindset and paradigms, and could learn pretty quickly*
- *Studied It = Have read books, docs, code, and possibly written limited code to practice concepts*
- *Used It = I have used it in projects and could write quality code in a professional context, without advanced features and tricks*
- *Experienced = I am confident using this professionally pretty much off the bat, at minimum in a junior role*
  
**Bolded** are items that I am most recently/currently working with or actively learning\
Empty slots are skills im either learning right now, or intend to learn soon
