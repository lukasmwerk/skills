Note: This is a tool that I actively use in my personal "practice time" as a software engineer. You may find it useful in getting a more nuanced picture of what I know, what I'm learning, and how I approach my craft.

The structure of this repo is essentially a documentation of my development, with some links and resources, notes and personal thoughts and plans.
