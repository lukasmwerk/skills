This repository is a personal log that I use to map out what I know and what I'm learning

- It can be used to understand my engineering skills, but since it includes everything I know, am learning, will learn and have learned but may not have in the front of my mind, it may not be the best method to quickly assess my skills at present, that should be left to my profile, job sites profiles or resume. This can serve as a way to look deeper into a certain skill that I listed, and what I know in relation to it.

- What I am logging in this repo is not necessarily related to my current job or involvement, most of that is in the realm of my employment, while this repo corresponds to my personal development as an engineer, and the choices of what I am currently learning or revisiting are personal choices and not necessarily bound to any employment or employment aspirations.

- This repo is not guaranteed to be 100% up to date, I may have not pushed changes yet, or maybe I haven't tracked or logged specific skills yet. Additionally, if you don't find a skill or technology here that doesn't necessarily mean I don't know it, it just hasn't been logged here.

- If you are taking inspiration from this repo or want to try something similar, just fork or copy it and run a script to empty the subfolders. I think starting with empty folders rather than my notes and materials is important.

- Some of the extra features and scripts can very much be works in progress, I don't prioritize stability for these pushes, it's just a log repo, so those extra features might be broken or incomplete at times.
